It's been a long time since something has been posted on this blog! And really, it's been quite a while since something has been done with the app at all. 

And the main reason for that is that I have been focussing more on mobile apps and web apps lately. Combine this with the fact that a Macbook Pro is the primary machine these days and there you have the reason for why this Windows/Visual Studio application has not been getting any attention at all.

But because there is the Mac and there is an increasing desire to learn Cocoa and Objective-C, I have been toying with the idea of porting over the current WPF-based Windows desktop application into a Mac app.

Stay tuned for updates!
